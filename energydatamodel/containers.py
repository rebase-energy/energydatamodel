"""Collection marker and container subclasses.

:class:`Collection` is an :class:`Element` whose primary purpose is grouping
other elements. It is **not** a :class:`Node`; collections aren't graph
vertices, just organizational/logical groupings. Collection shares the
``members`` and ``tz`` field shape with Node, but the semantics differ:
``isinstance(x, Node)`` on a Portfolio should return False.

Concrete subclasses carry no additional fields; they distinguish a Portfolio
from a Site at the type level for serialization / introspection / UI.

Conventions:

* ``Portfolio``: trading/asset aggregate. Typically no geometry.
* ``Site``: a geographic site containing assets. Typically a ``Point`` geometry.
* ``MultiSite``: group of sites.
* ``Region``: a named geographic region with a ``Polygon`` / ``MultiPolygon``
  geometry. (Distinct from :class:`Area`: regions are not bound to a market /
  administrative scope.)
* ``EnergyCommunity``: members share resources/balance.
* ``VirtualPowerPlant``: traded flexibility aggregate.
